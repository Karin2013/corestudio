                This project is to create narratives and tell a story using different online platforms. <br>
                My story is about Jenny who found an exhibition that she was interested and came to visit it. <br>
                She had trouble finding the exact location of the exhibition, but she solved the problem <br>through
                Google maps and wrote a review after her journey.
